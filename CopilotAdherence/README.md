### Overview

This project aims to evaluate the impact of GitHub Copilot on developer productivity within our organization. By leveraging GitHub's API, we systematically gather relevant metrics and store them in a MongoDB database. These metrics are then visualized through Grafana dashboards to provide insightful and actionable data on the usage and effectiveness of GitHub Copilot among our developers.

### Components
#####GitHub API
Used to retrieve data on commit frequency, pull request activity, and other relevant developer productivity metrics.

#####MongoDB 
Serves as the data storage solution, where all retrieved metrics are stored for historical analysis and trend monitoring.
#####Grafana
Utilized for visualizing the data stored in MongoDB through comprehensive dashboards, allowing for easy assessment of GitHub Copilot's impact on our development teams.

###Objectives
Assess Productivity: Determine whether GitHub Copilot enhances the productivity of our developers by comparing historical data before and after its introduction.

Identify Trends: Analyze trends related to code quality, bug frequency, and other significant parameters that affect software development efficiency.

Make Informed Decisions: Provide the management with data-driven insights to make informed decisions about future investments in developer tools and training.
